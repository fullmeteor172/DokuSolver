#Sudoku Sover + has a gui too!
Used this slick library to make it happen - https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

##Things to do:
- Optimize all that sloppy nested for code and use vectors
- Make the gui visualy show the backtracking process
- Make the game parse a file with strings of boards to questions
- Figure out how to avoid so much code repeating in the gui() funtion
- Go to bed, I never seem to be able to sleep on time...
