# C++ Sudoku Sover + has a game gui too!
Used this slick library to make it happen - https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

## Things to do:
- Optimize all that sloppy nested for code and use vectors
- Make the gui visualy show the backtracking process
- <s>Make the game parse a file with strings of boards to questions</s>
- Figure out how to avoid so much code repeating in the gui() funtion
- Need to add a Menu screen
- Need to add a You won screen
- Need to add make use of that screen scaling var for 4k monitors
- Need to fix the check() with a better system for 3x3
- Go to bed, I never seem to be able to sleep on time...

### Screen Shots:
- New game
